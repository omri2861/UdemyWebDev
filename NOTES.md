# Notes

In this markdown document, I will write my notes from the course.

Starting at,

## HTML - Basic

### Introduction to HTML

- HTML documentation: MDN, which stands for Mozilla Developer Network, managed by
  Mozilla
- There is also [devdocs](https://devdocs.io), like at work
- CodePen: A webiste to render webpages live, as you edit.

## CSS

### Introduction to CSS

- There is a nice MDN page to see all the colors you can specify with words.
  There's actually a ton of them.
- There's also a nice w3 schools page to see the default CSS which the browser
  uses, if no other CSS is provided.
- I have an idea about how CSS and rending works in general: I guess it's interpreted
  line-by-line, like python. I also guess that the browses always have a value for
  each CSS attribute as defaults, and any given CSS attribute simply overrides the past one.
  This also means that you can override yourself, so you need to be careful and organized.
- Another concept: Everything in web is a box, each with different attribtues (for example-
  some contains text, others images or links, and some are just visual separators). That's
  why all html elements have similar CSS attributes (almost).
